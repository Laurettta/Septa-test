// 1. what are the difference between var, let, and const?

// (a) var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped.They are only accessible within the function in which they are defined.

// (b) let are block scoped. They are only visible within the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which they are defined, such as within an if statement block.
// Use let when you need a variable that can change its value

// (c) const are block scoped. Variables declared with const are constants, meaning their value cannot be changed once its assigned
// const is also hoisted but are not initialized.
